## IntelMKLFixup
Dead-simple Intel(tm) MKL (Math Kernel Library) patcher for macOS, with a twist.

## Why?
Hackintoshes with AMD CPUs have infamously had a problem with software compiled against Intel's MKL, often resulting in many popular applications just not running correctly or at all.

This is where IntelMKLFixup comes in, IntelMKLFixup will *invisibly* patch bits of Intel's MKL in memory to help provide compatibility for AMD CPUs, without any user interaction or tweaking. Thus, allowing applications that once ran incorrectly or didn't work at all, to now run with little to no issues.

## Requirements
